# Investigating the role of neuroinflammation in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis using hiPSC-Microglia

This repository contains the scripts used for image analysis in this thesis project.

To begin, create a conda environment. Use the following command to create a new environment from the environment.yml file:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

The notebooks contain the scripts needed for automating puncta analysis and skeleton-spine density analysis. All you need to do is replace the input and output directories with the ones your images are stored in.
